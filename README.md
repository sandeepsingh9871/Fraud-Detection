# Fruad-Detection
# Problem Formulation
Due to the private nature of financial data, there is a lack of publicly available datasets that can be used for analysis. In this project, a synthetic dataset, publicly available on Kaggle, generated using a simulator called PaySim is used. The dataset was generated using aggregated metrics from the private dataset of a multinational mobile financial services company.

There are 6362620 instances of data set, The data set has 11 attributes which include is

    1.Type of transactions
    2.Amount transacted
    3.Customer ID and Recipient ID
    4.Old and New balance of Customer and Recipient
    5.Time step of the transaction
    6.Whether the transaction was fraudulent or not

# Steps to follow
It is a Binary Classification Problem

       General Overview: Have a General Overview of the data
       EDA: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to gain more clear insights of the data
       Data Preprocessing: With the information gained after performing EDA, Preprocess the Data accordingly
       Model Building: Once the data is properly cleaned and preprocessed, use this data to build a Machine Learning
       Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the Hyperparameters of the best performing model
       Model Performance: Assess the Performance of the Model on the Testing data set
       Save the model: Save the Best Performing Model
       Predictions: Make Predictions on the Testing data set
